# Contributing code changes
Changes to QUIC are initially committed to the [Chromium repository](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/net/quic/?q=net/quic). Roughly once a week a Google developer will bundle up recent changes in Chromium's QUIC code and add them to this repository (proto-quic). 

**To contribute code changes to proto-quic you should [submit patches upstream to Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/developers/contributing-code).**

# Other changes
For non-code changes, any contributors must sign the google CLA (https://cla.developers.google.com/clas) before sending pull requests to proto-quic.
